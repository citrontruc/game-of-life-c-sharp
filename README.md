# GameOfLife c-sharp

Version 1.0.0 on 20250823

## Description

This repository is an implementation of the game of life as described in the rules of [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

Furthermore, the user can change the grid of the game of life by inverting the value of some of the squares of the grid.

## Launch this repository

This project uses the Raylib library.

You can launch the project by typing the command
```bash
dotnet run .
```

This will launch a game of life with the field initialized at random. Parameters (ex: size of grid) can be changed in the file Program.cs

## Player Controls

The user can change the value of certain cells. In order to move the player (represented by a blue cube), use the arrow keys. Press the space bar to pause the game of life and then change the value of a cell in the grid either by left clicking on it or by moving the player to it and pressing enter.


Have a great day.
